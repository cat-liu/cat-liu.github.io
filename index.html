        <h2>[ka-thee-lee-oo] product manager</h2>
        <p>Product is my strongest skill set: at Buji, a consumer marketplace startup I co-founded, I leveraged customer conversations, comprehensive market research, and user-centric design to launch several product features to support business owners through livestream video. At Didi, I spent a summer in Shanghai and got into the weeds with engineering to bridge cross company product collaboration to internationally launch Didi’s car rental product to 175 countries as a joint project with Avis Car Rental. I’ve gone deep on business operations at Intel, where I spent several years harnessing data analytics and project management skills to drive supply-chain operations and grow revenue for client and data center businesses. I’ve also done product design for Sam Altman for an open source project he founded during the 2020 pandemic, helpwithcovid.com. I received my Bachelor of Science in Management Science with a secondary in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego and was an On Deck Founder Fellow (ODF10).</p>
