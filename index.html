        <h2>[ka-thee-lee-oo] product manager</h2>
        <p>My name is Cathy and I’m savvy in a wide variety of disciplines. Throughout my career, 
            my managers and peers have thought of me as a “swiss-army knife”. </p>
        <p>Product is my strongest skill set: at Buji, a consumer marketplace startup 
            I co-founded, I leveraged customer conversations, comprehensive market research, and 
            user-centric design to launch several product features to support business owners 
            through livestream video. At Didi, I spent a summer in Shanghai and got into the weeds 
            with engineering to bridge cross company product collaboration to internationally launch 
            Didi’s car rental product to 175 countries as a joint project with Avis Car Rental. I’ve 
            gone deep on business operations at Intel, where I spent several years harnessing data analytics 
            and project management skills to drive supply-chain operations and grow revenue for client 
            and data center businesses. I’ve also done product design for Sam Altman for an open source 
            project he founded during the 2020 pandemic, helpwithcovid.com. I received my Bachelor of 
            Science in Management Science with a secondary in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego and was an 
            On Deck Founder Fellow (ODF10).</p>
        <p>While I am not working, I enjoy traveling around the world, working on my wellness in pilates 
            classes, learning about film photography, discovering lesser known musicians, and indulging 
            in provocative Netflix documentaries.</p>
        <p>I love consumer marketplaces and am curious about adjacent sectors that could transform the 
            space, such as fintech, AI, social media, and logistics. I am currently located in SF Bay Area.
