            <p class="smallParagraph" id="paragraph2">My name is <b>Cathy</b> and I’m savvy in a wide variety of disciplines. Throughout my career, 
                my managers and peers have thought of me as a “<b>swiss-army knife</b>”. </p>
            <p class="smallParagraph" > My most recent journey was co-founding <b>Buji</b>, a consumer marketplace startup. We learned the stories 
                of more than 250 local merchants and helped them connect with their audiences and build their storefronts through livestream video.</p>
            <p class="smallParagraph" >Before Buji, my path was shaped by diverse interests; such as, immersing myself in tech cultures abroad. I spent 
                some time in Shanghai in the product team at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/didi-chuxing-avis/" target="_blank">Didi</a>
                where I dove deep into China's car rental scene. In partnership with Avis, we worked with engineering to launch a car rental product to 
                175 countries internationally. My curiosity about supply-chain operations grew during my time at <b>UC San Diego</b>, where I studied 
                Management Science with a secondary in Cognitive Science. This path led me to business operations at <b>Intel</b> where I was entrusted 
                with overseeing the growth of 18 client and data center product lines. </p>
            <p class="smallParagraph" >Beyond my professional endeavors, I find great fulfillment in leveraging my skills to help others. I had the 
                unique opportunity to collaborate with <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1239990683118768128?lang=en" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a> 
                and ship product design for the open source project, <a href="https://www.helpwithcovid.com/" target="_blank">helpwithcovid.com</a>.</p>
            <p>While I am not working, I enjoy traveling around the world, working on my wellness in pilates 
                classes, learning about film photography, discovering lesser known musicians, and indulging 
                in provocative Netflix documentaries.</p>
            <p>I love consumer marketplaces and am curious about adjacent sectors that could transform the 
                space, such as fintech, AI, social media, and logistics. I am currently located in SF Bay Area. 
                I am open to chatting about new ideas, please reach out!</p>
