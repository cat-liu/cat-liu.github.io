        <p class="smallParagraph" id="paragraph2">My name is <b>Cathy</b> and I’m savvy in a wide variety of disciplines. Throughout my career, 
            my managers and peers have thought of me as a “<b>swiss-army knife</b>”. </p>
        <!-- <p class="smallParagraph" >Product is my strongest skill set: at <b>Buji</b>, a consumer marketplace startup 
            I co-founded, I leveraged customer conversations, comprehensive market research, and 
            user-centric design to launch several product features to support business owners 
            through livestream video. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/didi-chuxing-avis/">Didi</a>, I spent a summer in Shanghai and got into the weeds 
            with engineering to bridge cross company product collaboration to internationally launch 
            Didi’s car rental product to 175 countries as a joint project with Avis Car Rental. I’ve 
            gone deep on business operations at <b>Intel</b>, where I spent several years harnessing data analytics
            and project management skills to drive supply-chain operations and grow revenue for client 
            and data center businesses. I’ve also done product design for <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1239990683118768128?lang=en">Sam Altman</a> for an open source 
            project he founded during the 2020 pandemic, <a href="https://www.helpwithcovid.com/">helpwithcovid.com</a>. I received my Bachelor of 
            Science in Management Science with a secondary in Cognitive Science at <b>UC San Diego</b> and was an 
            <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/">On Deck Founder Fellow (ODF10)</a>.</p> -->
        <p class="smallParagraph" > My latest professional journey was co-founding <b>Buji</b>, a consumer marketplace startup 
            where we learned the stories of more than 250 local merchants to help them connect with their audience and 
            grow their businesses through livestream video.</p>

        <p class="smallParagraph" >Before Buji, my career took some interesting turns based on my interests. I enjoy learning about tech cultures 
            in other countries, so I spent a summer in Shanghai in product at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/didi-chuxing-avis/" target="_blank"> Didi </a>
            diving deep into China's car rental scene. We launched a car rental product, in collaboration with Avis, to 175 countries internationally.</p>
            
        <p class="smallParagraph" >My curiosity in supply-chain operations grew during my time at <b>UC San Diego</b>, where I studied Management Science 
            with a secondary in Cognitive Science. This path led me to business operations at <b>Intel</b> where I was trusted to 
            oversee the growth of over $250M in annual revenue for 18 client and data center product lines.</p>
            
        <p class="smallParagraph" >I find great fulfillment in using my skills to support those in need and had the unique opportunity to work with 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1239990683118768128?lang=en" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a> and ship product design for his open source 
            project founded during the 2020 pandemic, <a href="https://www.helpwithcovid.com/" target="_blank">helpwithcovid.com</a>. </p>

        <p>While I am not working, I enjoy traveling around the world, working on my wellness in pilates 
            classes, learning about film photography, discovering lesser known musicians, and indulging 
            in provocative Netflix documentaries.</p>

        <p>I love consumer marketplaces and am curious about adjacent sectors that could transform the 
            space, such as fintech, AI, social media, and logistics. I am currently located in SF Bay Area. 
            I am open to chatting about new ideas, please reach out!</p>
